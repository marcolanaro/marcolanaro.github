          After earning a master's degree in telecommunication engineering, I
          worked as consultant for 5 years gaining in-depth knowledge in various
          industries. In 2015 I moved to London, switching from consultancy to
          work on e-commerce products with Trainline. The dualism between deep
          technical knowledge and delivery oriented mentality has allowed me to
          become a key player in Trainline, where I use my transversal skills to
          coach and mentor colleagues.

        <p>
          Responsible for the delivery of the project, I manage 4 squads
          composed by 1 team leader and 5 developers each. <br />
          I act as a mediator between product owners, business analysts and team
          leaders. My ability to communicate with the business as well as with
          technical people, help me taking pragmatic decision on how to

        <h3>Trainline</h3>
        <p>Development Team Lead</p>
        <small>October 2016 – October 2017 | London, United Kingdom</small>
        <p>
          Responsability of a stream of delivery, managing the backlog of a team
          of 8 people including me and one quality expert. Break down functional
          requirements into atomic Jira tickets so to iterate fast with quick
          scrum cycles (1 week). Cross team planning and scrum of scrum
          bi-weekly meetings with all the team leaders. <br />
          Selected the technical stack of the new re-platforming project started
          in October 2016. Decided for cutting edge technologies that allow us
          to reduce the costs of maintainance and increase velocity. On top of
          react/redux we decided to manage side effects with redux-observables
          and RxJS because I think that functional programming is a must and
          need to be enforced so to reduce the amount of spaghetti-code.
          Codebase written in Typescript to improve the developer experience
          with clever Intellisense and increase velocity on refactoring time.
          Avoided CSS specificity problems and increased CSS maintainability,
          using css-in-js framework. Unit tests written in Jest/Enzyme. Backend
          for frontend written in Node/Express reusing react/redux stack to
          handle server side rendering of the homepage for SEO purpose.

        <h3>Trainline</h3>
        <p>Agile Developer</p>
        <small>July 2015 – September 2016 | London, United Kingdom</small>
        <p>
          Full agile build process working with a continuous delivery
          environment. Drive direction on use of CSS and JavaScript frameworks
          to create a full responsive website, as well as use of appropriate
          testing frameworks at a JavaScript unit level (Mocha, Jasmine) and
          browser driven acceptance test level (CasperJS, Webdriver.io). <br />
          Rebranded the entire booking flow using LESS and Knockout.js in a .NET
          MVC environment; CasperJs acceptance tests. <br />
          Implemented the new payment confirmation page using pure react
          components. <br />
          Implemented a spike around the new international flow using react with
          inline style and redux as flux architecture. Unit tests implemented
          with mocha. <br />
          Leaded the development on the entire implementation of the new booking
          flow on mobile web. Used as less dependences as possible and get a
          first load in less then 1.5 seconds. We achieve a great goal using
          flexbox inline styles on react UI components, no external UI
          libraries. Good reusability of react components achieved by
          normalizing all the data on the node.js server before landing on the
          redux store. Functional programming and one way data flow permitted us
          to be agile and write completely dumb, stateless and easy to test
          components. Good separation of concerns thanks to proper actions
          creations that were dispatching only the payload needed to the reducer
          functions to manipulate the state. Unit tests using Mocha and browser
          based acceptance tests using Webdriver.io.

        <p>Founder & CIO</p>
        <small>May 2004 – December 2008 (4 years 8 months) | Italy</small>
        <p>
          I developed a role play game. That was implemented on a web app in
          multiple themed chat. Two years later the game was played nationwide
          and my interest in doing better took me to rewrite all the code using
          innovation technologies and an artistic vision to develop
          applications: PHP5 and MySQL server side; javascript with the
          prototypejs framework client side. The game application has been
          successful and in 2006/2007 there were two hundred of users at pick in
          the mean time, fifteen thousand of registered users. I sell that my
          first project to a manager in the Padua Area to dedicate myself to the
          studies. During the years I always was interested to web technologies,
          I worked with comet server and passed to ruby languages, I tried a lot
          of client and server framework but only in 2010 i fall in love: I
          discover node.js, the innovative platform languages that permit me to
          create all I want in javascript.

          In this repository you can find some ugly code written by the same
          intelligent and attractive 🙊 person speaking at you at the moment.
          <br />
          The aim was to:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Go 100% functional with one little compose function and many
            composable helper. I have to admit that after an initial slow down
            on creating composable helpers, I saw my productivity increasing
            exponentially.
          </li>
          <li>
            Focus on performances, so you'll find opinable best practices around
            fonts, inline code, service workers cache, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            Beautiful and snappy
