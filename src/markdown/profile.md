I am a development manager at Trainline who is passionate about
creating web applications and delivering an exceptional user
experience.

After earning a master's degree in telecommunication engineering, I
worked as consultant for 5 years gaining in-depth knowledge in various
industries. In 2015 I moved to London, switching from consultancy to
work on e-commerce products with Trainline. The dualism between deep
technical knowledge and delivery oriented mentality has allowed me to
become a key player in Trainline, where I use my transversal skills to
coach and mentor colleagues.
